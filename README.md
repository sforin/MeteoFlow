# MeteoFlow
MeteoFlow is a microservices-based data pipeline that simulates a network of distributed weather stations. Sensor data is streamed in real time using Kafka, stored in PostgreSQL, and made accessible via a RESTful API built with FastAPI.  The project showcases a full backend architecture with containerized services (Docker), real-time data streaming, database integration, and API exposure â€” designed to demonstrate production-ready skills for backend and data engineering roles.
